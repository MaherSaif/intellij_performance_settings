Performance Tips: System 
- IDEA is heavily IO-bound 
- Do not store sources, caches or system directories on network drives 
- Disable antivirus scanning for system directory 
- Regularly run disk defragmenter 
- Turn off Windows System Restore 

Performance Tips: JVM 
- In –server mode, increasing –Xmx helps IDEA’s caches live longer 
- Parallel GC helps on multicore machines 
- However : May cause stability issues. YMMV. 

Performance Tips: IDE 
- Use latest version 
- Disable unused plugins 
- Exclude unneeded folders 
- Set version control to None for generated code 
- Avoid large number of unversioned files 
- Do not disable “Synchronize files on frame activation” 
- Switch Project view to “Project” rather than “Packages” 
- Disable expensive inspections 
- Disable framework-specific validation on Make 
- Do not use method breakpoints
